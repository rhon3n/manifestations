__I asked for a polka-dot duck as a sign that my team is watching.__

## May 18

Desiree had told me 2 days ago that on her normal morning walk, she saw a picture of a rubber duck with a zig-zag pattern, framed in a box. Today she sent me a pic of it and she didn't even notice that it has polka dots! The polka dots were just for me—thank you spirit team!
